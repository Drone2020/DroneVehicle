Camera-equipped drones can capture targets on the ground from a wider field of view than static cameras or moving
sensors over the ground. We present a large-scale vehicle detection and counting benchmark, named DroneVehicle,
aiming at advancing visual analysis tasks on the drone platform. The images in the benchmark were captured over various urban
areas, which include different types of urban roads, residential areas, parking lots, highways, etc., from day to night. Specifically,
DroneVehicle consists of 15,532 pairs of images, i.e., RGB images and thermal infrared images with rich annotations, including oriented object bounding boxes, object categories, etc. With
intensive amount of effort, our benchmark has 441,642 annotated instances in 31,064 images.
